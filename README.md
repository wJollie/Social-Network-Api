# Social Network API

## Description
Syntax and Structure help from Google/Chatgpt. Readme generated by chatgpt

This project is a RESTful API for a social network web application that allows users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage their friend lists. The API is built using Express.js for routing, MongoDB as the NoSQL database, and Mongoose as the Object Data Modeling (ODM) library. It is designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data efficiently.
